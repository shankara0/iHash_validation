Token Validation & Brute Force Script
This Python script performs token validation against a web service endpoint. It utilizes the requests, hlextend, and base64 libraries to construct and send HTTP requests, aiming to identify valid tokens.

Functionality:
Token Validation: Validates tokens against a specific web service URL.
Brute Force Approach: Iterates through a range of tokens to identify valid ones.
Response Analysis: Checks HTTP responses for the presence of specific keywords to determine token validity.

Key Components:
Web Request Function: check_for_fail function makes HTTP requests and analyzes responses for token validation.
Token Generation: Generates tokens using cryptographic operations provided by the hlextend library.
Custom Headers: Utilizes custom headers for the HTTP requests to the target URL.

Usage:
Configure the url variable with the target web service URL.
Run the script, which iterates through a range of tokens to identify valid ones.
