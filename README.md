👋 Hi, I’m @shankara0

👀 I’m passionate about ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and CTF challenges on platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and various other cybersecurity platforms.

🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in penetration testing methodologies, network security, cryptography, and exploit development to continuously improve my knowledge and proficiency in the field of cybersecurity.

💡 I love writing scripts in Python, PHP, and several other languages to automate tasks, develop security tools, and explore various cybersecurity concepts.

💞️ I’m keen to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, open-source tools, and challenges that enhance practical knowledge in offensive security and cybersecurity as a whole.
